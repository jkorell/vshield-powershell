```
# Connect to the vShield Management appliance.  This isnâ€™t a real connect it just creates the client object and I figured it would
# be easier to just do this once then every get or set call.
$connect = Connect-VShield -Server "https://10.53.2.103" -User "admin" -Password "default"
 
#Create a firewall rule
#Get the current firewall rules.
$firewallRules = Get-FirewallRule -Client $connect -InternalPortGroupMofId "dvportgroup-2735"
#The API requires that when you add a rule that you send all existing rules back.
Set-FirewallRule -Client $connect -InternalPortGroupMofId "dvportgroup-2735" -DstIp "10.53.2.246" -DstPort "445" -SrcIp "any" -SrcPort "any" -Action "allow" -Direction "both" -Protocol "tcp" -FirewallRules $firewallRules
 
 
#Create a firewall rule with a IP range
